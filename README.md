# Re-Identification-in-Single-Feed
This project demonstrates real-time player detection and re-identification in a 15-second sports video using a custom YOLOv5 object detection model. The key objective is to consistently assign unique IDs to players — even when they leave and re-enter the frame — simulating a real-time tracking system.
